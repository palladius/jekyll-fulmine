## IDeas

For search some ideas:

* Bard tells me to try lunr.js. So googling Lunr+Jekyll I get this:
  * <https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/jekyll-search-using-lunr-js/>
  * <https://jekyllcodex.org/without-plugin/search-lunr/>
* I asked Bard for some existing Themese which are good for searching and he said:
  * 👎🏾 `Hyde`. Actually in the demo site i see no search <https://hyde.getpoole.com/> nope
  * 👍 `Minimal Mistakes`: i actually like this search: <https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/>. I give it an 8.
  * `Basically Basic` demo seems nice search. I give it a 7.5. <https://mmistakes.github.io/jekyll-theme-basically-basic/>
  * `Devlopr` 616 stars, last commit 9mo: demo <https://devlopr.netlify.app/#/>. Oh wow, thje search is a 7.5 but the blog style
    is AMAZING: <https://devlopr.netlify.app/blog/#/>and the blog pages are similar to what we want. Wow.
    Lets start with this!
